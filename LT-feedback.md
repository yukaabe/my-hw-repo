***Project 2: Classification of Bookings***  
Great project, and the data is there! Don't have much to comment on! You would have tons of data to work with, and many different models to try out.



***Project 3: Yelp Reviews***  
This is equally awesome! There are tons of models you could use, but I think this may be slightly more suited for a multi-label classification problem! A review can be one or all of these classes. You could predict *how many* of each it gets, but it might be more insightful, given the problem, to model the probability of each class given the review data!
