**Overall:** Fantastic work on this homework assignment! You nailed down the fundamentals, and did a great job on the bonus question as well. The next homework assignment will be a great test to try and take this plan and execute on it!


**Some Notes**

* *Q.3b* You can test for outliers with this method, via the interquartile range, but you could also apply some statistical tests! For example, a t-test on specific, suspicious points.

***Bonus:***
* Regarding the R^2 value and linear regressions, we haven't gotten into this yet, but this is technically a different problem. In a linear regression, or all *"regression"* type problems, you are modeling a continuous, real value (like ad spend). In the case of binary admission to grad school (1=admit, 0=not admit), we are doing classification. This leads to a different group of models for the task. For these models, you can use/interpret an R^2 value, but it's slightly different in it's interpretation! We will discuss this more in class later, but just as a heads up! Awesome job mentioning it though! Given if it were a pure regression problem, this is exactly what you could do.

**Something to think about**

We touch on this a bit in class, but think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc. For example, there are specific tests which will estimate how close a given distribution is to a normal distribution.
